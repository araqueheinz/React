## Summary
In this section, we explored JSX and some of the differences with HTML. For example:

- Styling in JSX
- ClassName Vs Class
- htmlFor vs for (labels)
- Referencing JS Variables 
- Property Names

## What is JSX?
JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX is a preprocessor step that adds XML syntax to JavaScript. Babel is used to process that JSX as well. No browser natively understands what JSX is, so before the JSX is sent to the browser it gets converted into normal looking JS code. Try it!
