## Summary
This is the beginning of learning React. The idea behind deleting everything from the src folder is to start from the bottom-up to learn properly how every piece works together. At the moment we started by:

 - `npm create-react-app myjsx`
 - Deleting everything from the src folder.
 - Creating an index.js inside the src folder.
 - Import the React and ReactDom libraries.
 - Create react component (Function or Class).
 - Take React Component and show it to the screen.
