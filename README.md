# Intro to Redux 

## Summary
In this section we are going to learn about **Redux**. First, we started by understanding redux on its own. Then, we learned how it works with React all together.

### What is Redux?
Redux is a state management library that makes creating complex apps a little bit easier. Redux can be used with any other JavaScript framework or library, like Angular.

### Redux Cycle
- Action Creator
- Action
- Dispatch
- Reducers
- State


## Project Ahead (Songs & Redux) - Part 1 out of 1 FINAL
We are going to create a simple app to learn how to incorporate Redux with React. One the left side of the screen we are going to create/display a component that will hold an array of objects. This array will be a list of "hard-coded" songs. On the right side of the screen we are going to create/ display a component that will hold the details of the song the user has selected.

### Tasks:
- Create a **Reducer** that is going to produce a list of songs.
- Create a **Reducer** that records what the current selected song is.
- Create an **Action Creator** that will change our **state**

### Tools
- Redux
- React-Redux 
- Semantic UI: https://semantic-ui.com/ is a modern front-end development framework, powered by LESS and jQuery. It has a sleek, subtle, and flat design look that provides a lightweight user experience.


### Usage
- Redux: `npm i redux`
- React-Redux: `npm i react-redux`
- Semantic UI: We are going to use a link to a publicly hosted version of the Semantic UI CSS file https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/semantic-ui/2.4.1/semantic.min.css instead of downloading it. In the /public/index.html we are going to add a "Link" tag. Example: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/semantic-ui/2.4.1/semantic.min.css" />`
